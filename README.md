<p><a href='https://github.com/shukkkur/Finch-Beaks-And-Statistics/tree/main/datasets' target="_blank">Data</a> from Peter and Rosemary Grant research of Darwin's finches on Gal√°pagos island of Daphne Major.

<h3>1. EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches</h3>
<p>First let's see how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species <i>Geospiza scandens</i> has changed over time. </p>

```python
_ = sns.swarmplot(x='year', y='beak_depth', data=df)
```

<p>It's hard to see if there is a clear difference between the <b>1975</b> and <b>2012</b> data set. But, it appears as the mean of the 2012 dataset might be slightly higher, and it might have a bigger variance.</p>


<h4>ECDFs of beak depths</h4>

```python
x_1975, y_1975 = ecdf(bd_1975)
x_2012, y_2012 = ecdf(bd_2012)

_ = plt.plot(x_1975, y_1975, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_2012,y_2012, marker='.', linestyle='none')
```

<p>The differences are much clearer in the ECDF. The mean is larger in the 2012 data, and the variance does appear larger as well.</p>

<h4>Parameter estimates of beak depths</h4>

```python
# the difference of the sample means: mean_diff
mean_diff = diff_of_means(bd_2012,bd_1975)

# bootstrap replicates of means
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975, np.mean, size=10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012, np.mean, size=10000)

# samples of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_diff_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])

print('difference of means =', mean_diff, 'mm')
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'mm')

>>> difference of means = 0.22622047244094645 mm
>>> 95% confidence interval = [0.05633521 0.39190544] mm
```
